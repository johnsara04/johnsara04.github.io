            <p class="blog-post-meta" id ='Jan2019'>Jan 20, 2019 by <a href="#Jan2019">John</a></p>


         <p>I have no idea how popular this Games Workshop game is though as they have recently released the Battle of Pelennor fields box set so there must be a market I guess. Of all the GW products I have always thought that the LOTR miniatures are the finest they have ever made having gained this impression through visiting Warhammer World and seeing the huge range on display. The sculpting is phenomenal with the character figures actually looking like the actors. This must be very difficult and is noticeably not the case with some ffg miniatures from another Galaxy far far away…</p>

         <p>As such I am always happy to get commissions for LOTR and recently have painted a few Rohan figures, plastics and resins, and enjoyed them all. First up some Rohirrim Cavalry.</p>

          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>


         <p>The design of these miniatures with what looks like the Sutton Hoo helmet and Late Roman/Byzantine scale type armour is arresting and puts me in mind of both early Saxons and Romano British. The green cloaks and shields unite the units visually as well. They have a real Dark Ages warband feel about them and again make me think of an Arthurian warlord such as may have inhabited the ruins of the Roman fort at Birdoswald.</p>

        <p> 
         As an aside my great uncle William Henry Johnson served alongside JRR Tolkien in the same battalion in WW1 until Tolkien was invalided out in 1916. Tolkien was the Signals officer for the battalion and had a team of around 15 Signallers handling communications within the battalion area, mainly using runners I imagine and my great uncle was one of those signallers. Unfortunately WH Johnson was killed at the end of October 1918. Weirdly my father was also a signaller and ran for the Army and my daughter is an Elite level runner…. </p>

         <p>Returning to the Rohirrim there were also foot figures matching the Cavalry in every way. In my pictures I separated them into men with Hand weapons, those with bows and those with spears as below</p>

<p><strong>The Characters</strong><br />These figures were done slightly later than the previous when I was experimenting with a black background – jury still out – and are resin. I don’t know if this is the finecast resin or something new but it was sharp and easy to work with so no complaints. The arrows and spear were a bit wobbly but  it was easy to cut and almost as smooth as the plastics.</p>

 <p>  One of my favourite characters from LOTR with Bernard Hill delivering a great doomed king hoping to rejoin his son Theodred in whatever passes for Rohirrim heaven. The miniatures sre astounding with more details revealing themselves as you paint them, mainly horse based detailing! The mounted version which was built with the helmet on though I think a bare headed version is available – for Theoden not the horse. The horse is the famous Snowmane which rather clumsily falls on Theoden at Pelennor fields. Probably did loads of good stuff in its life and is remembered forever for one mistake…   </p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Malifaux - the Lilith crew</h2>

            <p class="blog-post-meta" id ='Jan2019'>Jan 12, 2019 by <a href="#Jan2019">John</a></p>


         <p>In a typical misalignment in my timing I have just entered the world of Malifaux and painted up a Lilith crew just in time for her to disappear storywise from the plot….. although to be honest as I will never play a tournament it makes no difference whatsoever to me and I will continue to lose running the Nicole Kidman lookalike Lilith. Check the interweb if you don’t believe me. So here is my initial Lilith gang plus Nekima who was absent for the group photo.</p>

         <p>If you are here hoping for tactical insight you are definitely in the wrong place, I’m a newbie and pretty rubbish as well. As I said previously these Malifaux figures are my personal treat between painting Bolt Action and 40k commissions, a change of style and tempo.</p>

 <div class="col-md-12">
          <figure class="figure">
         <a target="_blank" href = "./blog_images/jan12/Picture1.jpg"> <img  class="blog-image blog-image-small img-responsive right-block" src="./blog_images/jan12/Picture1.jpg" alt="Not working..."></a>
          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>


         <p>I like to use crews as close to the theme as possible both for fluff and aesthetic reasons and despite an unbroken record of defeats so far will continue to do so convinced that if I play a bit better I will get the wins. As with all the crews I am building they will share a common base style which will be both factional and crew based so here the bases are made using the greenstuffworld Cthulu roller and coloured purple/green. The Pandora crew I am currently painting will have the same roller but be purple and blue.</p>

        <p> <strong>Lilith – mother of monsters</strong><br />
          Here is the girl herself with 2 of the three Terror Tots I have. This crew with the Black Blood Shaman and/or upgrades can in the right circumstances convert Nephilim including Terror Tots upwards into young Nephilim and even Mature Nephilim. The Terror tots are also useful Scheme runners I believe using Sprint. </p>

          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p> <strong>Nekima</strong><br />
          I am yet to use Nekima as I’ve only just painted her but her miniature is pretty cool and she looks happy to rip your throat out so that’s good… </p>


 
     <div class="col-md-12">

          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        
 <p> <strong>Barbaros</strong><br />  Another miniature I am failing to use properly so far who’s most interesting feature to date is that he appears to be left handed in reality but right handed on the box art and 3d design picture on the rear of the box… To date his greatest achievements in my less than capable hands were killing Nino Latigo after I forgot I was supposed to take him prisoner and slaughtering Papa Loco with deleterious effects all round.</p>
 <p>Currently thinking that even though its my fault he has been useless, I’m seriously considering benching him for Nekima. He’s kind of like a star striker who isn’t getting the service and gets blamed for the team losing…
</p>
      

        <div class="col-md-12">

        </br>

        <p></p>

 <p> <strong>Young Nephilim</strong><br />  
These have some good combat stats and can fly which is cool. They can also upgrade to mature Nephilim with some Neverborn shenanigans which will be great when I finally manage it. One of mine came without a head which has been replaced with another Demonic type head as you can see. I am keeping a blue green skin tone for all the Nephilim including Barbaros as a way to tie in with Lilith’s sword and cloak. The human head has been done slightly more vivid than reality to set off the Nephilim colour while the beheader is sat on a pice of 40k street furniture that was in the bits box

          </figure>
        </div>
  


 <p> <strong>Malifaux Cupid and Black Blood Shaman</strong><br />  
So both potentially useful I imagine…in the hands of somebody semi competent. In my defence I put the Shaman in the woods on the assumption that with those bloody great wings he could fly. Instead of which he just dragged his wings through the brambles for 3 turns arriving at the fight in time to do absolutely bloody nothing and then dying. Next time…</p>
<p>In summary I like the theme and the relationships between the miniatures. The potential for really clever coordinated play is there and hopefully with a few more games I will start being less of a numpty and do them justice.  I will have the mature Nephilim painted in the next few days I hope and maybe he will give me the punch I need to kill that danged Perdita!</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Starting Malifaux</h2>

            <p class="blog-post-meta" id ='Jan2019'>Jan 6, 2019 by <a href="#Jan2019">John</a></p>


         <p>I had heard of Malifaux for many years but had little idea of what type of game it was thinking vaguely it was some sort of Steampunk RPG. It was the figures which I saw expertly painted that drew me in and I bought some figures off Ebay to paint really just to practise a different style of painting to my usual bread and butter of 40k and Bolt Action. The first group of figures included what I now know as the Latigo crew which are a sort of Outlaw Western gang but working for the Law…</p>

 <div class="col-md-12">
          <figure class="figure">
         <a target="_blank" href = "./blog_images/jan1/Picture1.jpg"> <img  class="blog-image blog-image-small img-responsive right-block" src="./blog_images/jan1/Picture1.jpg" alt="Not working..."></a>
          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>


         <p>This crew is led by the lady in the middle and is made up of her Latino family and are apparently famed Neverborn monster hunters. It’s a shooty type crew which isn’t all that common in Malifaux.</p>


  <div class="col-md-12">
          <figure class="figure">
         <a target="_blank" href = "./blog_images/jan1/Picture2.jpg"> <img  class="blog-image blog-image-small img-responsive right-block" src="./blog_images/jan1/Picture2.jpg" alt="Not working..."></a>
          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

      <p> This is Perdita Latigo – which I think means ‘little girl lost’ in Spanish and she basically bosses the crew and shoots like a machine gun. The ‘lost’ element seems to suggest she has some link to the Neverborn she hunts and her pet is the enslaved Neverborn by her side. I suspect ongoing plot reveals in future… </p>
      <p>Second in command is Francisco who has some cool abilities and good melee which means he is often drafted by other Guild crews. The Guild being the proto fascist colonist power which rules the human parts of Malifaux.</p>


 
     <div class="col-md-12">
          <figure class="figure">

          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        
<p>  Next is Santiago who appears less frequently, presumably as players value him less for his points cost. Good model though. Appearing here next to a guild rifleman who provides some longer range kapow.</p>
      

        <div class="col-md-12">

        <span>

        </br>

        <p></p>

 <p style="margin-top:3cm;">There are a number of lesser Latigos including Nino with a sort of machine gun rifle who can help stop enemy figures achieving their aims as well as good shooting. Papa Loco who can be used as a suicide bomber or to hand out buffs to other Latigos, and Santana Latigo who appears to be constantly blowing holes in Zombies.

  <p style="margin-top:3cm;"> </br>This basic crew can be rounded out with pistoleros and even Abuela Latigo but I don’t have these models…yet. I do however have Miss Terious, a female Death Marshall and atrocious pun. Like the other Death Marshalls she has a magical coffin for imprisoning baddies but as she is female does not have the glowy flamey face of the other Death Marshalls. She is probably meant for the Lady Justice crew but they await painting.

            <p class="blog-post-meta" id ='Jan2019'>Jan 5, 2019 by <a href="#Jan2019">John</a></p>


         <p>Recently I have winter Camo’d several vehicles for various customers and thought to take some pictures while doing this T34. As a result here is a quick “How I do…” on winter camouflage.</p>

      <p> <strong>Step 1 </strong><br />
First take your painted T34. Here I’ve got a Bolt Action 28mm T34 and painted  up and varnished in the usual manner with the modulation probably overdone for the purpose. Subsequently I’ve discovered that cruder slightly darker modulation actually works better with snow camo. Some minor weathering is already done as the AFV will usually have some ‘history’ before being whitewashed and some will show through ie some chipping.

       </p>

          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

 <p> <strong>Step 2 </strong><br />
Spray the whole thing with the worn effects/chipping fluid, I used ak interactive because it’s what I had but other makes seem to be just as good. It took 3 fine sprays for a decent coat. I then left it for 30 minutes to dry. It looks quite shiny once its done.

       </p>
   <div class="col-md-12">
          <figure class="figure">
         <a target="_blank" href = "./blog_images/jan2/Picture3.jpg"> <img  class="blog-image blog-image-small img-responsive right-block" src="./blog_images/jan2/Picture3.jpg" alt="Not working..."></a>
          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>


  <p> <strong>Step 3 </strong><br />
As I had gone to the trouble of decaling the model and I probably wouldn’t remember where the decals were under the whitewash I popped a bit of panzer putty roughly around the decals and the stowage, then sprayed several very fine coats of thinned down ‘white’ over the superstructure. It was actually model color off white or ivory. Pure white looks a tad harsh I think but that’s purely a personal choice. It may well be that the chemical composition of whatever they used as whitewash was really white but I don’t know and prefer my way…. The result below.
</p>

       </p>
   <div class="col-md-12">
          <figure class="figure">
         <a target="_blank" href = "./blog_images/jan2/Picture4.jpg"> <img  class="blog-image blog-image-small img-responsive right-block" src="./blog_images/jan2/Picture4.jpg" alt="Not working..."></a>
          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>


<p><strong>Step 4 </strong><br />
Wearing away the whitewash. I have never whitewashed a tank - or anything else actually - so now it was imagination time trying to think of where on the model would the whitewash wear away quickest. I imagined on areas where there was footfall or friction and where rain, or melting snow, would cause run off speeding up wear. This process involves using a brush and just gently brushing on water onto the areas you want to wear away and letting the magic of the previously applied chipping fluid do its thing. You can control wear by the type of brush, amount of water and pressure of strokes.

          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

The photo above shows some harsh wearing using the stubby short brush which produced quite hard flaking with very little water brushed on. For the softer additions simulating water action I used the longer haired brush brushing the water on gently in a vertical direction. The T34 has some nice sharp edges I rubbed with a cocktail stick to reveal the paint underneath. Its nice if the white is more transparent in some areas as well which is best done when laying down the spray.

          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

<p><strong>Step 5 </strong><br />

  Once you are happy with the wear and distribution of the whiteness spray some varnish on as otherwise it will keep wearing when you don’t want it to….hard lesson learned there!

<br />
Now its weathering time. When I first started weathering I used to get carried away and the vehicle ended up looking like a scrapheap. Less really is more and especially over the ‘white’ as its effectively a blank canvas. Here I used a bit of winter streaking and normal streaking from the AK interactive range(?).

         <a target="_blank" href = "./blog_images/jan2/Picture7.jpg"> <img  class="blog-image blog-image-small img-responsive right-block" src="./blog_images/jan2/Picture7.jpg" alt="Not working..."></a>
          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

<p><strong>Step 6 </strong><br />
Final step was to add the snow and ice on the tracks. It is possible to add the snow/ice to other areas but again my lack of tank based experience means im not 100% sure where icy snow would stick. I assume it would slide off sloped surfaces as it does off your car when in motion and not last near the engine.

         <a target="_blank" href = "./blog_images/jan2/Picture8.jpg"> <img  class="blog-image blog-image-small img-responsive right-block" src="./blog_images/jan2/Picture8.jpg" alt="Not working..."></a>
          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>


<p>The snow was made using a proprietary snow mixed with some crushed glass and a water effects liquid. Just varying the amounts produces drier or wetter snow and good ice. I think I got mine from secret weapon miniatures but there are probably other sources. I also used the wet effects on the mud gloop applied earlier to the tracks.
