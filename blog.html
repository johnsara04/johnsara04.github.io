            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Starting Malifaux</h2>

            <p class="blog-post-meta" id ='Jan2019'>Jan 6, 2019 by <a href="#Jan2019">John</a></p>


         <p>I had heard of Malifaux for many years but had little idea of what type of game it was thinking vaguely it was some sort of Steampunk RPG. It was the figures which I saw expertly painted that drew me in and I bought some figures off Ebay to paint really just to practise a different style of painting to my usual bread and butter of 40k and Bolt Action. The first group of figures included what I now know as the Latigo crew which are a sort of Outlaw Western gang but working for the Law…</p>

 <div class="col-md-12">
          <figure class="figure">
         <a target="_blank" href = "./blog_images/jan1/Picture1.jpg"> <img  class="blog-image blog-image-small img-responsive right-block" src="./blog_images/jan1/Picture1.jpg" alt="Not working..."></a>
          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>


         <p>This crew is led by the lady in the middle and is made up of her Latino family and are apparently famed Neverborn monster hunters. It’s a shooty type crew which isn’t all that common in Malifaux.</p>


  <div class="col-md-12">
          <figure class="figure">
         <a target="_blank" href = "./blog_images/jan1/Picture2.jpg"> <img  class="blog-image blog-image-small img-responsive right-block" src="./blog_images/jan1/Picture2.jpg" alt="Not working..."></a>
          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

      <p> This is Perdita Latigo – which I think means ‘little girl lost’ in Spanish and she basically bosses the crew and shoots like a machine gun. The ‘lost’ element seems to suggest she has some link to the Neverborn she hunts and her pet is the enslaved Neverborn by her side. I suspect ongoing plot reveals in future… </p>
      <p>Second in command is Francisco who has some cool abilities and good melee which means he is often drafted by other Guild crews. The Guild being the proto fascist colonist power which rules the human parts of Malifaux.</p>

          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        
<p>  Next is Santiago who appears less frequently, presumably as players value him less for his points cost. Good model though. Appearing here next to a guild rifleman who provides some longer range kapow.</p>

        <p></p>

 <p style="margin-top:3cm;">There are a number of lesser Latigos including Nino with a sort of machine gun rifle who can help stop enemy figures achieving their aims as well as good shooting. Papa Loco who can be used as a suicide bomber or to hand out buffs to other Latigos, and Santana Latigo who appears to be constantly blowing holes in Zombies.

I do however have Miss Terious, a female Death Marshall and atrocious pun. Like the other Death Marshalls she has a magical coffin for imprisoning baddies but as she is female does not have the glowy flamey face of the other Death Marshalls. She is probably meant for the Lady Justice crew but they await painting.

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Winter Camouflage for a T34 </h2>

            <p class="blog-post-meta" id ='Jan2019'>Jan 5, 2019 by <a href="#Jan2019">John</a></p>


         <p>Recently I have winter Camo’d several vehicles for various customers and thought to take some pictures while doing this T34. As a result here is a quick “How I do…” on winter camouflage.</p>

      <p> <strong>Step 1 </strong><br />
First take your painted T34. Here I’ve got a Bolt Action 28mm T34 and painted  up and varnished in the usual manner with the modulation probably overdone for the purpose. Subsequently I’ve discovered that cruder slightly darker modulation actually works better with snow camo. Some minor weathering is already done as the AFV will usually have some ‘history’ before being whitewashed and some will show through ie some chipping.

       </p>
        
  <div class="col-md-6">
          <figure class="figure">
         <a target="_blank" href = "./blog_images/jan2/Picture1.jpg"> <img  class="blog-image blog-image-small img-responsive right-block" src="./blog_images/jan2/Picture1.jpg" alt="Not working..."></a>
          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <figure class="figure">
         <a target="_blank" href = "./blog_images/jan2/Picture2.jpg"> <img  class="blog-image blog-image-small img-responsive right-block" src="./blog_images/jan2/Picture2.jpg" alt="Not working..."></a>
          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

 <p> <strong>Step 2 </strong><br />
Spray the whole thing with the worn effects/chipping fluid, I used ak interactive because it’s what I had but other makes seem to be just as good. It took 3 fine sprays for a decent coat. I then left it for 30 minutes to dry. It looks quite shiny once its done.

       </p>
   <div class="col-md-12">
          <figure class="figure">
         <a target="_blank" href = "./blog_images/jan2/Picture3.jpg"> <img  class="blog-image blog-image-small img-responsive right-block" src="./blog_images/jan2/Picture3.jpg" alt="Not working..."></a>
          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>


  <p> <strong>Step 3 </strong><br />
As I had gone to the trouble of decaling the model and I probably wouldn’t remember where the decals were under the whitewash I popped a bit of panzer putty roughly around the decals and the stowage, then sprayed several very fine coats of thinned down ‘white’ over the superstructure. It was actually model color off white or ivory. Pure white looks a tad harsh I think but that’s purely a personal choice. It may well be that the chemical composition of whatever they used as whitewash was really white but I don’t know and prefer my way…. The result below.
</p>

       </p>
   <div class="col-md-12">
          <figure class="figure">
         <a target="_blank" href = "./blog_images/jan2/Picture4.jpg"> <img  class="blog-image blog-image-small img-responsive right-block" src="./blog_images/jan2/Picture4.jpg" alt="Not working..."></a>
          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>


<p><strong>Step 4 </strong><br />
Wearing away the whitewash. I have never whitewashed a tank - or anything else actually - so now it was imagination time trying to think of where on the model would the whitewash wear away quickest. I imagined on areas where there was footfall or friction and where rain, or melting snow, would cause run off speeding up wear. This process involves using a brush and just gently brushing on water onto the areas you want to wear away and letting the magic of the previously applied chipping fluid do its thing. You can control wear by the type of brush, amount of water and pressure of strokes.
</p>

 <div class="col-md-12">
          <figure class="figure">
         <a target="_blank" href = "./blog_images/jan2/Picture5.jpg"> <img  class="blog-image blog-image-small img-responsive right-block" src="./blog_images/jan2/Picture5.jpg" alt="Not working..."></a>
          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

The photo above shows some harsh wearing using the stubby short brush which produced quite hard flaking with very little water brushed on. For the softer additions simulating water action I used the longer haired brush brushing the water on gently in a vertical direction. The T34 has some nice sharp edges I rubbed with a cocktail stick to reveal the paint underneath. Its nice if the white is more transparent in some areas as well which is best done when laying down the spray.

</p>

 <div class="col-md-12">
          <figure class="figure">
         <a target="_blank" href = "./blog_images/jan2/Picture6.jpg"> <img  class="blog-image blog-image-small img-responsive right-block" src="./blog_images/jan2/Picture6.jpg" alt="Not working..."></a>
          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

<p><strong>Step 5 </strong><br />

  Once you are happy with the wear and distribution of the whiteness spray some varnish on as otherwise it will keep wearing when you don’t want it to….hard lesson learned there!

<br />
Now its weathering time. When I first started weathering I used to get carried away and the vehicle ended up looking like a scrapheap. Less really is more and especially over the ‘white’ as its effectively a blank canvas. Here I used a bit of winter streaking and normal streaking from the AK interactive range(?).

 <div class="col-md-12">
          <figure class="figure">
         <a target="_blank" href = "./blog_images/jan2/Picture7.jpg"> <img  class="blog-image blog-image-small img-responsive right-block" src="./blog_images/jan2/Picture7.jpg" alt="Not working..."></a>
          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

<p><strong>Step 6 </strong><br />
Final step was to add the snow and ice on the tracks. It is possible to add the snow/ice to other areas but again my lack of tank based experience means im not 100% sure where icy snow would stick. I assume it would slide off sloped surfaces as it does off your car when in motion and not last near the engine. 

 <div class="col-md-12">
          <figure class="figure">
         <a target="_blank" href = "./blog_images/jan2/Picture8.jpg"> <img  class="blog-image blog-image-small img-responsive right-block" src="./blog_images/jan2/Picture8.jpg" alt="Not working..."></a>
          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>


<p>The snow was made using a proprietary snow mixed with some crushed glass and a water effects liquid. Just varying the amounts produces drier or wetter snow and good ice. I think I got mine from secret weapon miniatures but there are probably other sources. I also used the wet effects on the mud gloop applied earlier to the tracks.
