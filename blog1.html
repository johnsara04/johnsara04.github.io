            <h2 class="blog-post-title">21st Panzer in Normandy</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta" id ='Feb2018'>Feb 1, 2018 by <a href="#">John</a></p>

         <p>A recent commission involved painting a significant number of Battlefront vehicles as 21st Panzer as they existed in Normandy in 1944. This was an interesting job as not only were the vehicles not the standard German vehicles of the time but also the camouflage used appears to have been less than standard….</p>


 <div class="col-md-6">
          <figure class="figure">
          <img  class="blog-image blog-image-small img-responsive right-block" src="./blog_images/Picture20.png" alt="Not working...">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>


         <p>The division itself was a rebuild of the famous 21st Panzer of Afrika Korps fame which had surrendered in 1943 at the end of that campaign. I assume some survivors had been shipped across to Italy before the end to be used as a cadre and that there were sufficient Panzer IVs around to create at least one battalion. However it is the rest of the divisions assets which are really interesting as they appear to have recycled large numbers of French tanks and vehicles captured in 1940. These were “re-imagined” by a Major Becker using local workshops and resources much like a modeller scratch building some new creation. One example is the APC which normally would be an sdkfz 251 but here is a Somua APC</p>

<span>
  




       <p>  Built on the chassis of a Somua artillery tow these were used by the panzergrenadiers of the division in Normandy.</p>
       <p>The same chassis seems to have been reused for several vehicles such as this rocket launcher
       </p>

             <p>This anti aircraft vehicle with a 20mm cannon</p>

          <img  class="blog-image img-responsive center-block" src="./blog_images/Picture22.png" alt="Not working...">

             <p>And this anti tank jagdpanzer type vehicle with a 75mm Pak 40 fixed atop.</p>


       <div class="col-md-12">
          <img  class="blog-image img-responsive center-block" src="./blog_images/Picture23.png" alt="Not working...">
        </div>

          <p>Major Becker appears to have been captured in Alsace in 1944 and then disappears so whether he survived or died as a prisoner I don’t know but he certainly had a way with half tracks. </p>
          <p>He also used other items of captured French equipment especially for the mobile artillery such as these 150mm guns on Lorraine chassis
</p>


       <div class="col-md-12">
          <img  class="blog-image img-responsive center-block" src="./blog_images/Picture24.png" alt="Not working...">
        </div>

          <p>Or the 105mm version.

</p>

  <div class="col-md-12">
          <img  class="blog-image img-responsive center-block" src="./blog_images/Picture25.png" alt="Not working...">
        </div>
        <p>Both of which are reincarnations of earlier versions created under similar circumstances of necessity in North Africa by imaginative and desperate German engineers.

</p>

        </div>

<p> He also used Hotchkiss H39 tank chassis as the basis for some vehicles presumably on the principle of why the hell not? These mounted both 105mm guns as ersatz Wespe mobile artillery as below;
</p>
<div class="col-md-12">
          <img  class="blog-image img-responsive center-block" src="./blog_images/Picture27.png" alt="Not working...">
        </div>
<p> And as tank hunters with the Pak 40 which to my eye looks a bit like a Hetzer in outline but obviously without a lid. I imagine these vehicles probably had a limited combat life due to using poorer quality plate steel, overloaded engines and a lack of spares.
</p>

          <img  class="blog-image img-responsive center-block" src="./blog_images/Picture28.png" alt="Not working...">

<p>In any event they and the rest of 21st panzer were “used up” in Normandy and although remnants were still around at the start of 1945 not as a divisional force and probably having abandoned the eclectic collection of Summer 1944.</p>
<p>
As mentioned the second element of interest for me was the camouflage. I would have lost count of the number of German AFV I’ve painted in the classic 1944 3 colour camo if I’d ever started a count. In 21st Panzer they appear to have adopted a different approach, a more ‘no dress code’ just express yourself approach. Not only does the photographic evidence show different styles between units of the same vehicles it also seems to vary within units as shown in the photograph below.</p><p>
 I imagine that there were several possible reasons for this. Firstly the vehicles were produced at different times, possibly in different workshops who interpreted camouflage differently. Secondly in 1943 and early 1944 when the se vehicles were being built and delivered paint for the Normandy front was probably not the highest front so local supplies of ‘near enough’ were used.</p>

          <img  class="blog-image img-responsive center-block" src="./blog_images/Picture29.png" alt="Not working...">
        </div>



<p>Thirdly platoon commanders were probably not particularly fussed about the paint schemes as spending time and effort was like putting perfume on a pig. Possibly all three. I somehow doubt that my favourite possible reason of artistic German commanders feeling less inhibited in France just allowing their crews to express their feelings in camouflage is unlikely….In any event to retain some sort of homogeneity I tried to use the same camouflage within a platoon but differed by type of vehicle. This gave the impression of diversity without being jarring. I hope.

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Dark Angels
</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta" id ='Jan2018'>Jan 31, 2018 by <a href="#">John</a></p>

         <p>I’ve never really painted any 40k figures before apart from 5 Sisters of Silence which came to me with something else, so decided to give them a go and started at the shallow end with some figures I reckoned were not so baroque that I would be unable to transfer my 15mm armour techniques on to. Dark Angels fit the bill with their largely monocolour liveries of green, bone and black for Marines, Deathwing and Ravenguard respectively.</p>
         <p>
The figures are from the Dark Vengeance box which were easy to put together which is a bonus as I don’t like this part of the process and get annoyed beyond reason when working on small plastic parts which ping off the desk onto the floor and scurry into the hardest places to find..</p>
<p>Anyway first up a Pair of Dark Angel Marines. At this point for full disclosure I think I need to point out that I don’t play 40k so I may make mistakes with terminology.
</p>

   <div class="col-md-6">
          <figure class="figure">
          <img  class="blog-image blog-image-small img-responsive right-block" src="./blog_images/Picture11.png" alt="Not working...">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <figure class="figure">

          </figure>
        </div>

       <span>

             <p>These were initially airbrushed with GW Caliban green from their airbrush range in the annoying little flip top lid flasks which mean you have to use a pipette to remove or lose some paint every time you pour into the airbrush. Having moaned the actual paint seems to cover and flow well enough. This was then followed with subtle modulation using Vallejo modelair greens (Cam Olive Green and Cam green). In retrospect I think I needed a little more highlight but was working with the dark part of Dark Angel at the front of my mind. </p>


             <p>The fellow below with the big red gun shows a bit more of the effect and actually its more pronounced in real life than in the photos.</p>


       <div class="col-md-12">
          <img  class="blog-image img-responsive center-block" src="./blog_images/Picture13.png" alt="Not working...">
        </div>

          <p>Next up were the Deathwing who with their bigger surfaces were my favourites for modulation and much more like the German Dunkelgelb I’m more familiar with.
</p>


       <div class="col-md-12">
          <img  class="blog-image img-responsive center-block" src="./blog_images/Picture14.png" alt="Not working...">
        </div>

          <p>These were undercoated black for heft then Burnt Umber, Khaki Brown,Light Brown, Sand and final highlights with a Sand/White mix – again all Vallejo Modelair.  A very weak Agrax glaze smoothed out the whole and edges were highlighted with an even lighter Sand/White. Im pleased with these guys though the faces look like grumpy baboons.

</p>

  <div class="col-md-12">
          <img  class="blog-image img-responsive center-block" src="./blog_images/Picture15.png" alt="Not working...">
        </div>
        <p>Finally the Ravenwing (who are nothing to do with Ravenclaw apparently) and their cool black 1950s James Dean black leather look. Apart from this guy who is making the basic flowing robe and spinning machinery mistake pointed up in “The Incredibles”.

</p>
<div class="col-md-12">
          <img  class="blog-image img-responsive center-block" src="./blog_images/Picture16.png" alt="Not working...">
        </div>

<p> Seriously unless it’s a special magic robe it’s going to get caught in the rear wheel and pull him off. Maybe that’s why hes’ bald – too many robe caused falls
</p>
<div class="col-md-12">
          <img  class="blog-image img-responsive center-block" src="./blog_images/Picture17.png" alt="Not working...">
        </div>
<p> However, rule of cool it looks good I decided not to modulate the black and just do the panel edges as neatly as possible and concentrate on the more eye-catching parts such as the wingy bits.
</p>



   <div class="col-md-6">
          <figure class="figure">
          <img  class="blog-image blog-image-small img-responsive right-block" src="./blog_images/Picture18.png" alt="Not working...">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <figure class="figure">
          <img  class="blog-image blog-image-small img-responsive right-block" src="./blog_images/Picture19.png" alt="Not working...">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

       <span>



<p>So that’s my first sortie into 40k and im pretty happy overall. Lessons learned are to do a tiny bit more highlight even though they are dark and mean and secretive (so I believe). I have a few other bits I’m painting up ( Primaris squads and Assault squads) then hi ho hi ho to Ebay it will go.</p>

          <div class="blog-post">
            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta" id ='Jan2018'>Jan 29, 2017 by <a href="#">John</a></p>

<h2>Hello There</h2>
         <p>Thanks to my foresight many years ago in producing a daughter capable of building websites I now have the capacity to inflict photographs of painted miniatures onto a cold uncaring world. 

</p>
        

 <div class="col-md-12">
          <img  class="blog-image img-responsive center-block" src="./blog_images/Picture6.png" alt="Not working...">
        </div>

        <p>Allied to this thanks to my erstwhile employer, I now also have the time on my hands (and a decent redundancy payment) to do so for some little while. Like the bloke from The A team said “I love it when a plan comes together”. Except there was never an actual plan as such.
</p>


 <div class="col-md-12">
          <img  class="blog-image img-responsive center-block" src="./blog_images/Picture7.png" alt="Not working...">
        </div>

         <p>Anyway, point is through this website I am able to display my wares to whosoever wants to see them and perhaps buy them. Everything on the site has been painted by myself and has sold or is being sold. 
         </p>

         <p>


I used to be an active wargamer - meaning I went running and played football as well as wargaming - but now I’m an inactive non wargamer as now I do none of the above due to my knees being worn out/knackered by too many miles/ injuries and developing a preference for board games such as Advanced Squad leader and C&C Napoleonics. 
 </p>


         <div class="col-md-12">
          <img  class="blog-image img-responsive center-block" src="./blog_images/Picture8.png" alt="Not working...">
        </div>


        <p>This move to boardgaming came about as a damascene revelation that what I really liked about figure gaming was actually just the figures. The lengthy setting up, the grail quest for decent rules, the infinite measuring of arcs and ranges then packing up after a couple of turns wasn’t why I played. It was the painting of figures! As a result I flogged all my miniatures to fund the hobby of painting and turned to boardgaming to get the gaming fix.
</p>


              <div class="col-md-6">
          <figure class="figure">
          <img  class="blog-image blog-image-small img-responsive right-block" src="./blog_images/Picture9.png" alt="Not working...">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption">Chilling out</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <figure class="figure">
          <img  class="blog-image blog-image-small img-responsive right-block" src="./blog_images/Picture10.png" alt="Not working...">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption">Unleashed</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <span>

          <p>Now unbound I no longer needed to paint what was needed for the latest rules set but could paint whatever I fancied and sell the finished product on Ebay. So here I am complete with new-fangled website. I’m not sure about the whole blog thing as I’m not convinced that anyone will be interested in my witterings however the success of Facebook seems to suggest that lots of people are interested in other peoples’ irrelevant doings so I’ll give it a go and will accept failure as proof that gamers have higher standards!
